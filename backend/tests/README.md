This folder contains unit tests for the backend modules.

## Running Tests
To run all backend tests:

python -m unittest discover
```

## Adding Tests
- Place new test files here, following the `test_*.py` naming convention.
- Each test file should import the relevant backend modules and use the `unittest` framework.
